    <h1>Katte Siva Priya, acts in a play</h1>
    <p>
        A spacious, handsome, and tastefully furnished drawing room,
        decorated in dark colours.  In the back, a wide doorway with
        curtains drawn back, leading into a smaller room decorated
        in the same style as the drawing-room.  In the right-hand
        wall of the front room, a folding door leading out to the
        hall.  In the opposite wall, on the left, a glass door, also
        with curtains drawn back.

<p>
    [Stops close to the door, listens, and says softly:]
</p> 
<p>
    Upon my word, I
    don't believe they are stirring yet!

<p>
    [Also softly.]
</p> 
<p>
    I told you so, Miss. Remember how late the steamboat got
    in last night. And then, when they got home!--good Lord, what a lot the
    young mistress had to unpack before she could get to bed.
</p>

    <h5>
        MISS TESMAN.
    </h5>

  <p>
    [She goes to the glass door and throws it open.]
  </p>      

<p>
    Well well--let them have their sleep out. But let us see that they get a
    good breath of the fresh morning air when they do appear.
</p>

     

    <h5>
        BERTA.

<p>
    [Beside the table, at a loss what to do with the bouquet in her hand.]
</p>
<p>
    I declare there isn't a bit of room left. I think I'll put it down here,
    Miss.
</p> 
<p>
    [She places it on the piano.]
</p>

    <h5>
        MISS TESMAN.
    </h5>

        

<p>
    So you've got a new mistress now, my dear Berta. Heaven knows it was a
    wrench to me to part with you.
</p>

    <h5>
        BERTA.
    </h5>

    <p>
        [On the point of weeping.]
    </p>
        

 <p>
    And do you think it wasn't hard for me, too,
    Miss? After all the blessed years I've been with you and Miss Rina.(1)
 </p>

<h5>
    MISS TESMAN.
</h5>

<p>
    
We must make the best of it, Berta. There was nothing else to be done.
George can't do without you, you see-he absolutely can't. He has had you
to look after him ever since he was a little boy.
